# hassio_dockerimg_sslBased
this distro uses the same architecture as sinric pro, which ran on arm based servers
to configure the directory, add the required docker containers to the config file and merge it with the proxmox lite iso image
to merge the iso image and the yaml file, extract the iso and replace the yaml file.
please note that the zip file is 2048 bit encoded, it is recommended to have atleast 64GB of Ram, although the minimun requirement is 4gb.
